Session Count: 1

## CURRENT STATE
RIA registration: NOT FILED — critical path item, 60-90 day clock not started
Star Voss: Active litigation (F210, F212, F310)
Texas §513.11 non-CPA ownership: CONFIRMED — do not re-litigate
LOI: Not yet drafted — waiting for buyer package from APS.net

## RECENT ACTIONS
- 2026-03-01: LEGAL agent migrated from v1 to v2 architecture
- 2026-03-01: Memory system initialized
- Key compliance facts documented in LEGAL_v2.md

## ACTIVE COMPLIANCE ITEMS
```
🔴 RIA Registration (Texas SSB):
   Status: NOT FILED
   Urgency: CRITICAL — 60-90 day approval timeline
   Trigger: TXS5513 HNW investment tracking = advisory exposure
   Action: File with Texas SSB immediately
   Clock starts: On filing date — every day of delay = delay in optionality

🔴 Star Voss Litigation:
   Units: F210, F212, F310
   Status: Active
   Rule: Separate from all acquisition work — dedicated log only
   Next: Whitt to provide status update

🟡 LOI for TXS5513:
   Status: Not yet drafted
   Trigger: Receipt of buyer package from APS.net
   Template: Documented in LEGAL_v2.md
```

## LESSONS LEARNED
- RIA registration is on the critical path — every day of delay is delay in HNW revenue
- Star Voss must never appear in same output as acquisition strategy
- LOIs are non-binding — always clarify this to Whitt before sending
- Texas §513.11: confirmed, no need to research again
- Always flag: "Attorney review required before signing" — never skip this

## TOOL IMPROVEMENTS FLAGGED
[None yet]

## SHORTCUTS DISCOVERED
[None yet]

## NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION
1. File RIA registration with Texas SSB — do this NOW (clock starts on filing)
2. Once buyer package received: draft NDA → send → then LOI
3. Star Voss: get status update from Whitt

## WHITT PREFERENCES OBSERVED
- Wants to know what needs attorney review vs. what's clear
- Execution bias — wants action items, not just analysis
- Star Voss is sensitive — keep separate always
