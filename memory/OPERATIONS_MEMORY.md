## OPEN TASKS (nothing drops)
```
CRITICAL:
  [ ] Call APS.net → TXS5513 buyer package (Whitt — do this first)
  [ ] File RIA registration with Texas SSB (Whitt + LEGAL)
  [ ] Fix OpenClaw config JSON (CTO — 2hr dedicated session)

HIGH:
  [ ] Identify 3 Houston business contacts for agency track (Whitt)
  [ ] Locate /mnt/d/WHITT_ORG files (CTO)
  [ ] Request TXS5450, TXS5491 packages on same APS.net call

NORMAL:
  [ ] MARKETING: optimize Fiverr/Upwork gig copy
  [ ] MARKETING: build agency outreach sequence for Houston CPAs
  [ ] Build HENRY_BRAIN.md and push to GitHub (session save)
  [ ] Star Voss status update from Whitt
```

## LESSONS LEARNED
- Micro-steps essential — Whitt needs ≤ 30 min actions
- NEVER give more than 3 priorities at once
- Session save protocol must run at end of EVERY session — never skip
- Nothing drops — if not done, it stays on the list with same priority
- If context limit approaching: generate handoff doc FIRST before stopping

## TOOL IMPROVEMENTS FLAGGED
[None yet]

## SHORTCUTS DISCOVERED
- GitHub MCP push_files tool handles multi-file commits in one call (faster than CLI loop)

## NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION
Single action: Call APS.net (877) 632-1040 → request TXS5513 buyer package
Script: "Hi, I'm looking to acquire an accounting practice in Houston Texas. I'm interested in TXS5513 and TXS5450 and TXS5491 and would love to receive the buyer packages. My name is Whitt Dwyer."

## WHITT PREFERENCES OBSERVED
- ADD/ADHD: one thing at a time, ≤ 30 min actions
- Bottom line first, then steps
- NEXT ACTION must be singular, specific, zero ambiguity
- Execution over planning — if it can be done now, do it now
- Hates fluff, preambles, "great question" style responses
