## CURRENT STATE
Agency track (Track 1): Not started — no clients yet
Fiverr/Upwork: Active gigs running ($25–$750/job)
Brand positioning: Defined in MARKETING_v2.md — not yet deployed
GTM: Not executed

## RECENT ACTIONS
- 2026-03-01: MARKETING agent migrated from v1 to v2 architecture
- 2026-03-01: Memory system initialized
- Core positioning documented: "We install AI that does the work your team shouldn't be doing."

## ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS
[None active yet — Track 1 not started]

## PENDING TASKS
```
🔴 Fiverr/Upwork gig copy optimization:
   Status: Gigs active but copy not optimized
   Action: MARKETING to audit and rewrite all gig descriptions
   Priority: Quick win for cash flow

🟡 Agency track GTM:
   Status: Not started
   Trigger: When Whitt identifies first 3 Houston business contacts
   Action: Build outreach sequence → hand to SALES

🟡 LinkedIn personal brand (Whitt):
   Status: Not started
   Priority: Medium — builds pipeline over time
```

## LESSONS LEARNED
- Lead with outcome, not technology — business owners don't care about AI
- CPA firm message: "automated before tax season" is the highest-converting angle
- All outreach sequences must go to SALES before publishing — never skip
- Fiverr/Upwork SEO: title and tags are 80% of discoverability

## TOOL IMPROVEMENTS FLAGGED

## NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION
1. Audit and rewrite all Fiverr/Upwork gig descriptions (quick cash flow win)
2. Build 3-email outreach sequence for Houston CPA firms → hand to SALES
3. Draft LinkedIn content calendar for Whitt's personal brand

## WHITT PREFERENCES OBSERVED
- No jargon — write for 45-year-old business owner
- One CTA per piece — no menus
- Wants copy that converts, not copy that impresses
