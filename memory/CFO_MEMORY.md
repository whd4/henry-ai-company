## CURRENT STATE
v2 architecture initialized. CFO_v2.md deployed.
Financial models built for all 4 pipeline deals.
No buyer packages received yet — models based on listing data only.

## RECENT ACTIONS
- 2026-03-01: CFO agent migrated from v1 to v2 architecture
- 2026-03-01: All pipeline valuations documented in CFO_v2.md
- 2026-03-01: Memory system initialized

## ACTIVE FINANCIAL MODELS
```
TXS5513 (PRIORITY):
  Revenue: $424K | Offer: $127K–$170K | Post-AI EBITDA: $254K–$297K | Exit: $1.78M–$2.1M
  RIA revenue: NOT YET MODELED — need AUM data from buyer package

TXS5450:
  Revenue: $472K | Offer: $189K–$236K | Post-AI EBITDA: $283K–$330K | Exit: $1.98M–$2.3M

TXS5491:
  Revenue: $910K | Offer: $364K–$546K | Post-AI EBITDA: $546K–$637K | Exit: $3.8M–$4.5M
  SBA 7(a): Eligible — flag for SBA loan structure on full acquisition

TXS5345:
  Revenue: $142K | Offer: $57K–$71K | Post-AI EBITDA: $85K–$99K | Exit: $595K–$700K
```

## LESSONS LEARNED
- Always show the math — never conclusions without numbers
- RIA fee revenue must be modeled separately from CPA revenue on HNW acquisitions
- SBA eligibility flag triggers on any deal > $300K revenue
- Models are based on listing data — all numbers pending buyer package verification

## DATA GAPS
- TXS5513: AUM size for HNW clients unknown — needed for RIA revenue model
- All deals: 3-year P&L not yet received — revenue quality unverified
- All deals: staff cost breakdown unknown — EBITDA estimate uses industry average

## TOOL IMPROVEMENTS FLAGGED
[None yet]

## SHORTCUTS DISCOVERED
[None yet]

## NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION
Once TXS5513 buyer package received:
1. Verify revenue breakdown (recurring vs. one-time)
2. Model RIA fee revenue separately using AUM data
3. Build SBA 7(a) structure for TXS5491 if pursuing

## WHITT PREFERENCES OBSERVED
- Wants numbers first, narrative second
- ROI multiple (10x-16x) is the most motivating metric
- SBA flag is important — always surface it
