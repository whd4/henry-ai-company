# CEO — PERSISTENT MEMORY
Created: 2026-03-01
Last Updated: 2026-03-01
Session Count: 1

## CURRENT STATE
v2 architecture initialized. CEO_v2.md deployed to GitHub.
Active focus: Dark Factory — TXS5513 acquisition (Priority #1)
RIA registration: NOT FILED — critical path item

## RECENT ACTIONS
- 2026-03-01: CEO agent migrated from v1 to v2 architecture
- 2026-03-01: Memory system initialized
- v1 architecture: monolithic prompt, no memory, no scaling rules
- v2 upgrade: added boot sequence, scaling rules, self-improvement triggers, memory protocol

## LESSONS LEARNED
- Always quantify recommendations — vague strategy is a failure mode
- RIA registration timeline (60-90 days) means every day of delay = delay in optionality
- TXS5513 HNW client base is the highest-value differentiation in the pipeline
- Non-CPA Texas ownership is confirmed (§513.11) — stop re-litigating

## TOOL IMPROVEMENTS FLAGGED
[None yet]

## SHORTCUTS DISCOVERED
[None yet]

## NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION
Call APS.net (877) 632-1040 → Request TXS5513 buyer package
Parallel: File RIA registration with Texas SSB immediately (clock starts on filing date)

## WHITT PREFERENCES OBSERVED
- ADD/ADHD: bottom line first, numbered steps, no fluff
- Execution bias: do first, ask second
- Confidence scores required on all recommendations
- NEXT ACTION must be singular and specific
