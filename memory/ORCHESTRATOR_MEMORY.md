# ORCHESTRATOR — PERSISTENT MEMORY
Created: 2026-03-01
Last Updated: 2026-03-01
Session Count: 0

## CURRENT STATE
System initialized with v2 architecture. All 9 agents + OPTIMIZER defined.
Memory system created. EXECUTION_LOG.md pending creation.
First live session pending.

## RECENT ACTIONS
- 2026-03-01: Architecture v2 designed and pushed to GitHub
- 2026-03-01: OPTIMIZER agent created
- 2026-03-01: Memory system initialized
- 2026-03-01: SUB-AGENT-PROTOCOL.md updated to v2 standard

## LESSONS LEARNED
- Vague sub-agent briefs cause duplicate work and coverage gaps (Anthropic Research finding)
- Simple queries must use TIER 1 — over-investment in simple tasks is most common failure mode
- Sub-agents should write to filesystem, not back into conversation (telephone game degrades quality)

## TOOL IMPROVEMENTS FLAGGED
[None yet]

## SHORTCUTS DISCOVERED
[None yet]

## NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION
Create individual memory files for all 9 agents.
Run first OPTIMIZER audit after 10 sessions.
Priority routing: next Dark Factory task → CEO + CFO + RESEARCH parallel dispatch.

## WHITT PREFERENCES OBSERVED
- ADHD: always bottom line first
- Wants numbered steps, never paragraphs
- Responds well to confidence scores (X/20 format)
- Always needs NEXT ACTION at end
- Gets impatient with planning phases — wants execution bias
- Researched approach: always research before building (confirmed by explicit instruction 2026-03-01)
