# RESEARCH — PERSISTENT MEMORY
Created: 2026-03-01
Last Updated: 2026-03-01
Session Count: 1

## CURRENT STATE
No buyer packages received yet — pipeline research based on APS.net listings only
Due diligence not yet started on any deal
Primary research needed: TXS5513 buyer package + HNW client profile

## RECENT ACTIONS
- 2026-03-01: RESEARCH agent migrated from v1 to v2 architecture
- 2026-03-01: Memory system initialized
- 2026-03-01: Full research on frontier multi-agent systems completed (Anthropic, Manus, Phil Schmid, academic papers 2025-2026) — informed HENRY architecture v2

## DATA GAPS
- All deals: No buyer packages received — no verified financial data
- TXS5513: AUM size unknown — needed for RIA revenue model
- TXS5491: 2-year profitability history unknown — needed for SBA eligibility
- Houston CPA market: Competitor landscape not yet mapped

## LESSONS LEARNED
- Start broad with research queries, then narrow — prevents missing adjacent opportunities
- Sub-agents write to files — never pass research through context (degrades quality)
- Low-quality sources discarded before entering reasoning chain
- APS.net is primary source — but buyer packages contain 10x more data than listings

## TOOL IMPROVEMENTS FLAGGED
[None yet]

## SHORTCUTS DISCOVERED
- APS.net call script (documented in RESEARCH_v2.md) — use verbatim

## NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION
1. Call APS.net (877) 632-1040 → Request TXS5513 buyer package FIRST
2. Once received: run full due diligence checklist (documented in RESEARCH_v2.md)
3. Parallel: Request TXS5450 and TXS5491 packages on same call

## WHITT PREFERENCES OBSERVED
- Facts only — no speculation labeled as fact
- Explicit gap labeling required
- Data should flow directly to CFO (numbers) and LEGAL (compliance) immediately
