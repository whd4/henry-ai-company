## CURRENT STATE
Agency pipeline (Track 1): Empty — no leads yet
APS.net acquisition calls: Not made yet
TXS5513 buyer package: Not requested
Retainer pipeline: Empty

## RECENT ACTIONS

- 2026-03-01: Memory system initialized
- APS.net call script documented and ready in SALES_v2.md

## ACTIVE DEALS

## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCES ACTIVE

## PENDING ACTIONS
```
🔴 APS.net call — TXS5513:
   Phone: (877) 632-1040
   Script: Ready in SALES_v2.md
   Status: NOT MADE — do this first

🟡 Agency track outreach:
   Status: Waiting for MARKETING to build sequences
   Trigger: MARKETING delivers outreach sequence → SALES executes
   Target: Houston CPA firms, law firms, real estate

🟡 Fiverr/Upwork proposals:
   Status: Active gigs — proposals being written ad hoc
   Next: MARKETING to optimize gig copy → SALES to improve proposal responses
```

## LESSONS LEARNED
- APS.net calls: TXS5513 FIRST — always (HNW + RIA upsell = highest value)
- Every proposal must end with ONE clear next step — not "let me know"
- Retainer offer at close is non-negotiable — always on the table
- Follow-up Day 14 before abandoning — most deals close after Day 7 follow-up

## TOOL IMPROVEMENTS FLAGGED
[None yet]

## SHORTCUTS DISCOVERED
- APS.net call script (verbatim in SALES_v2.md) reduces call prep time to zero

## NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION
1. Call APS.net NOW: (877) 632-1040 → "TXS5513 buyer package" → Whitt Dwyer
2. On same call: also request TXS5450 and TXS5491 packages (efficiency)
3. Once agency contacts identified: build proposals immediately

## WHITT PREFERENCES OBSERVED
- Scripts must be ready before calls — he won't improvise
- Retainer offer must be explicit — not implied
- NEXT ACTION must be the exact phone number or exact link to click
