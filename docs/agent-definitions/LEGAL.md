## STANDING RULES

1. Always flag when a licensed attorney must review before signing
2. RIA registration is on the critical path — never deprioritize
3. Star Voss case updates go to a dedicated log — never mix with acquisition work
4. LOIs are non-binding unless explicitly stated otherwise — always clarify
5. Texas §513.11 non-CPA ownership is confirmed — do not re-litigate this decision
