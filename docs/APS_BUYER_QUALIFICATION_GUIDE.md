## WHAT YOU'LL NEED (typical buyer qualification)

Gather these before sitting down at the form:

### PERSONAL / ENTITY INFO
- [ ] Full legal name: Whitt Dwyer
- [ ] Entity name (which entity is buying): TBD — determine with CEO + LEGAL
- [ ] EIN or SSN for entity
- [ ] Business address
- [ ] Phone + email

### FINANCIAL QUALIFICATION
- [ ] Proof of funds or financing letter (shows you can close)
  - Options: bank statement, LOC letter, SBA pre-qualification, investor commitment
  - For deals $127K-$170K (TXS5513): need to show ~$170K accessible
- [ ] Net worth statement or summary
- [ ] Credit score range (often asked — 680+ preferred for SBA)

### ACQUISITION EXPERIENCE / INTENT
- [ ] Why you want to acquire an accounting practice (2-3 sentences)
- [ ] Your background / qualifications (1993 web dev company, AI automation experience)
- [ ] How you'll operate the firm (AI transformation model — keep it simple, don't over-explain)
- [ ] Timeline: when you want to close

### LICENSING (key question)
- [ ] Are you a CPA? → No
- [ ] Will there be a licensed CPA as responsible party? → Yes (Texas §513.11)
- [ ] Name that CPA if possible (or state "to be identified post-LOI")

## STRATEGY FOR THE FORM

**On "why do you want to buy this practice":**
> "I am acquiring accounting practices to modernize operations using AI automation tools, improving profitability while maintaining client relationships. I have a background in technology businesses since 1993 and am focused on the Houston market."

**On operating the firm:**
> "I plan to retain existing staff, designate a licensed CPA as responsible party, and implement AI workflow tools that reduce administrative overhead while improving client service."

**On financing:**
> Do NOT say "SBA loan" for TXS5513 at this stage (it's too small for SBA). Say cash/personal funds or LOC.
